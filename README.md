# K-Means-Clustering-ML-of-Dow-Jones-Index
## Description:
This project aims to use the K-Means clustering algorithm to categorize stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) based on their historical price data. By utilizing clustering techniques, we can group similar stocks together, offering insights into their price movements and correlations.

## Key Features:
- Data Acquisition: Fetches the list of DJIA stocks from Wikipedia.
- Data Cleaning: Processes and cleans the raw stock data, removing any NaN values to ensure robust clustering results.
- K-Means Clustering: Applies the K-Means clustering algorithm to group stocks based on features derived from their historical prices.
- Visualization: Uses matplotlib to visualize the resulting clusters, providing a clear overview of stock groupings.

## Technical Details:
- Languages & Libraries: Python, pandas, yfinance, scikit-learn, matplotlib.
- Machine Learning Technique: K-Means Clustering.
- Data Source: Stock data fetched from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library.
